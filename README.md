# FAAH inhibitor

*This is part of [heta-lang](https://insysbio.github.io/heta-lang/) project.*

This is Quantitative Systems Pharmacology (QSP) modeling platform describing Fatty Acid Amide Hydrolase inhibition in human.

## Model history

- The human model of FAAH inhibition was developed by InSysBio and Pfizer in 2012 to support the analysis of clinical data on perspective pain killer PF‚Äê04457845.
- The model was published in [CPT: Pharmacokinetics & Systems Pharmacology](https://ascpt.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1038/psp.2013.72) journal in 2014.
- The SBML code of the model was published on [BioModels Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/BIOMD0000000512) in 2014 under [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) license.
- In January 2016 it was model of the month of [BioModels Database](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/content/model-of-the-month?year=2016&month=01)
- In 2019 the model was published on GitHub as QSP modeling platform in [Heta notation](https://insysbio.github.io/heta-lang/).
